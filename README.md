I am a research fellow supervised by [Prof. James J. Collins](http://collinslab.mit.edu/) at the [Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering](https://wyss.harvard.edu/) at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/). I work at the intersection of computer science (mostly Bayesian nonparametrics and deep probabilistic programming) and biology (mostly systems and synthetic biology). 

I did my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at [IIT Delhi](http://www.iitd.ac.in/), where my research was primarily guided by [Dr. Sumeet Agarwal](http://web.iitd.ac.in/~sumeet/research.html) and I worked on causal models of gene regulatory networks.

My broad research interest is to apply mathematics and machine learning to better understand how complex biological and cognitive systems work.
