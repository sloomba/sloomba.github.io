I am a research fellow supervised by [Prof. James J. Collins](http://collinslab.mit.edu/) at the [Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering](https://wyss.harvard.edu/) at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/). I presently work at the intersection of computer science (mostly Bayesian nonparametrics and deep probabilistic programming) and biology (mostly systems and synthetic biology). 

I did my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at [IIT Delhi](http://www.iitd.ac.in/), where my research was primarily guided by [Dr. Sumeet Agarwal](http://web.iitd.ac.in/~sumeet/research.html). My bachelors' thesis focused on building causal models of gene regulatory networks.

My broad research interest is to apply mathematics and machine learning to better understand how complex biological, cognitive and eventually social systems work.

I also write sporadically on my [Medium](https://medium.com/@sahilloomba) about things that cross my mind.

# Research

I believe computation is a vital tool for understanding things at all levels of organization of the world. Right from the fundamental particles of the universe, to the biomolecules that make life possible, to the wonders of biological intelligence, up to the intricate social interactions that create human civilization. Although most of my work focuses on biological and cognitive systems, I like to situate my research in the context of this organizational hierarchy.
